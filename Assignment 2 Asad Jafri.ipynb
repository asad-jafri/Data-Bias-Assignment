The dataset includes a unique comment id, the text of the comment, and a series of binary labels applied by human raters: \"toxic,\" \"severe_toxic,\" \"obscene,\" \"threat,\" \"insult,\" and \"identity_hate.\" I have appended the \"score\" column, which represents the toxicity score assigned to the comment text by the live version of the Perspective API.
